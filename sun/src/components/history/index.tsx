      In a random talk with my friends they recommended me to read VAGABOND, who actually it&#39;s the same
      author&#47;mangaka of Slam Dunk &#40;Anime and Manga that i like a lot&#41;.

      So after reading it and found out that was on hiatus for so long, I decided to make a website that will help me to
      remember what&#39;s going on with this manga and keep an eye on it.

      I know there are many series with the same problem or even canceled and people like me who go late to the reading
      party they don&#39;t know what&#39;s the current situation. So wrapping up, for this reason I&#39;m planning to
      build the same project with more titles. When the project it&#39;s ready or even in a beta release, an
      announcement will appear in the home site, so stay stuned and hope you guys like it!
